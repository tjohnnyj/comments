Her response was \"It said it on the main page and that\\'s all that matters.\" Im going to be honest papa, I read the email and I didnt see it and I did see the ad on the site and just read the big print because I thought I had all the information from the email that you repetitively sent me. Regardless though I feel your site should\\'ve been able to indicate that the coupon code couldnt be used a 2nd time. \\n\\nThis is the 3rd time now where I ordered from your site and I got screwed by your website or this catch 22 BULLSHIT !!! I thought about it for a while and was considering just never ordering from the web site ever again in the future because of all the issues on there that happen to me. But then I realized that the website is the only way to get the rewards points. So then I would be losing out on the reward points for being a great customer. So Im at a conundrum here and the only option left for me to do is to just Never Buy Papa Johns Again! I do love your pizza, but it is expensive pizza for me considering I eat pizza twice a week.

Will you do anything against big banks and Wall Street? \"What do you say to Bernie sanders types....\" (aka the 99% of Americans getting ripped off by big money) explain.\\n\\nHillary: I went to Nasdaq and said hey you gotta cut it out.\\n\\nAny questions about her not doing a thing to help low, middle class people via REAL wealth redistribution? Get a clue Hillary bots. Put the pom poms down and up your game. Wealth redistribution is the most important issue BY MILES, effecting all races and people except the 1%, and this makes Bernie twice as good for this one issue ALONE, yet she has a superpac while claiming reform citizens united?? Uhhhhh, dont stand by your values or anything.\\n\\nJust gets uglier......\\n\\nHillary To Rachel Maddow: \"look at my actions... No one tells me what to do!!!\"\\n\\nOk......... So I did some looking and here\\'s what I found about her actions.\\n\\n1. Walmart board director for 6 years.. 2. private fund raisers with Goldman Sachs and other private equity firms... 3. attended Donald Trump\\'s wedding and received money from him (no joke) because she \"thought it would be fun\" 4. has a superpac to accept private big money donors while at the same time opposing citizens united. Need more red flags? Starting to see a pattern here. Bernie Sanders has no superpac but he does have max contribution limits from individual donors while refusing money from the rich. Wow! Conviction. Back to red flags...... 5. her son-in-law, Chelsea\\'s husband, being a hedge fund manager. 6. Hillary Clinton\\u2019s donors also include the drug maker Pfizer, ExxonMobil, Dow Chemical, Goldman Sachs, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and many more. 7. In the GMO debate, Mrs. Clinton has consistently sided with chemical ag. companies like Monsanto, who, not surprisingly, Hillary\\'s law firm represented and who is a large Hillary donor.\\n\\nSo no one tells you what to do......... unless they pay you off. Got it.\\n\\nHillary will be soft on real banking, wall street, and tax reforms FOREVER... She is a life long corporate shill for the political establishment.

Her response was \"It said it on the main page and that\\'s all that matters.\" Im going to be honest papa, I read the email and I didnt see it and I did see the ad on the site and just read the big print because I thought I had all the information from the email that you repetitively sent me. Regardless though I feel your site should\\'ve been able to indicate that the coupon code couldnt be used a 2nd time. \\n\\nThis is the 3rd time now where I ordered from your site and I got screwed by your website or this catch 22 BULLSHIT !!! I thought about it for a while and was considering just never ordering from the web site ever again in the future because of all the issues on there that happen to me. But then I realized that the website is the only way to get the rewards points. So then I would be losing out on the reward points for being a great customer. So Im at a conundrum here and the only option left for me to do is to just Never Buy Papa Johns Again! I do love your pizza, but it is expensive pizza for me considering I eat pizza twice a week.

Get a clue Hillary bots. Put the pom poms down and up your game. Wealth redistribution is the most important issue BY MILES, effecting all races and people except the 1%, and this makes Bernie twice as good for this one issue ALONE, yet she has a superpac while claiming reform citizens united??

So I did some looking and here\\'s what I found about her actions.\\n\\n1. Walmart board director for 6 years.. 2. private fund raisers with Goldman Sachs and other private equity firms... 3. attended Donald Trump\\'s wedding and received money from him (no joke) because she \"thought it would be fun\" 4. has a superpac to accept private big money donors while at the same time opposing citizens united. Need more red flags? Starting to see a pattern here. Bernie Sanders has no superpac but he does have max contribution limits from individual donors while refusing money from the rich. Wow! Conviction. Back to red flags...... 5. her son-in-law, Chelsea\\'s husband, being a hedge fund manager. 6. Hillary Clinton\\u2019s donors also include the drug maker Pfizer, ExxonMobil, Dow Chemical, Goldman Sachs, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and many more. 7. In the GMO debate, Mrs. Clinton has consistently sided with chemical ag. companies like Monsanto, who, not surprisingly, Hillary\\'s law firm represented and who is a large Hillary donor.\\n\\nSo no one tells you what to do......... unless they pay you off. Got it.\\n\\nHillary will be soft on real banking, wall street, and tax reforms FOREVER... She is a life long corporate shill for the political establishment.

When my dad came home one of the first things we did was go to Disneyland. That was back in the day when the admission price was low and you bought ticket books for the rides. We couldn't afford very many rides, but Disneyland was just a fun place to be, especially with my dad. Just after we entered the park, a man who was leaving with his family  approached my dad and handed him a wrist band. He said, here, wear this and you'll ride free with one of your kids.

Many people have asked if they could share, so yes ! Please feel free to share and to help others learn and understand and then do the right or better thing in our future, beginning now. Thank you! ~ Barbara Anne Kirkman~ November 22, 2015\\n\\nI was born during WWII, and as a small child my first friend outside of my immediate extended family, was Reiko, who had been born in an internment camp in CA. In high school I became friend\\'s with another refugee, Anna, who was from Hungry and in the 70\\'s and early 80\\'s, I was working as a volunteer helping Viet Namese, Cambodian and a few Laotians, who were refugees, from their respective countries, in all of their cases they faced horrid racism, discrimination and oppression often times in their beginning days of living here in the US. And then we have the Hispanics, who have come here from Mexico, and other places in Central and South America, and they too have been treated with homegrown hostilities from US citizens. Some Americans, fear the very worst when they come in contact with or hear that they might come in contact with people who are both refugees and immigrants, who look different that \"Americans,\" do not speak English as their first language, have different religious beliefs and customs. Some Americans are always convinced that the \"new people,\" are all murders, rapists and more and therefore they prejudge the new comers and mistreat them in inexcusable ways. I have not forgotten my histories, for in 1939 there was a boat filled with Jewish refugees which was turned away from our shores, because somehow some Americans believed that that was a boat load filled with Nazi\\'s. I am an American Native Indian, and as such, I have received from time to time the same treatment in some ways as all of those refugees in our history have received, so I do understand, that in the US history, the original refugees who landed on these shores from England, within the first 2 decades of their arrival, were refugees, who somehow thought that my ancestors could never measure up to the \"high standards,\" of the Colonialists, because my ancestors, did not speak the King\\'s English, did not worship in the \"Christian way,\" had different customs and oh yes were of a different skin color and dressed differently than the Colonials. And thus racism, discrimination, hate, fear mongering and warmongering began in the US some 395 years ago.', 21922: u\"It's 4:20pm, Sunday and I'm almost there...very excited!\", 9115: u'Brenda', 21931: u'Horrible show.

It is my fault for not checking with BBB or consumer affairs about the warnings they are posting that completely to a T describe your deceptive scammer policies. (See BBB) Besides that Your technology is years behind Netflix. Your user ability sucks. The glitches alone are not worth the headaches. The corruptness away from Christian values will send a multitude to HELL as you will be held responsible. Let me explain. Your default settings Show PORN Channels and Pornography stations where even the names and pictures could tempt and cause kids to adults to end up in Hell with you for causing these little ones to stumble.  Your family packages are laced with vile programing and commercials that are anything but family. Then you leave out of family packages cheap rerun stations which are the only stations that have awesome shows like Touched by an angel!!  And you want an extra 30 some dollars to get one channel.. No matter how hard me or your tec worked nobody could keep from showing non-package shows as part of my plan shows so over half of my set to record shows were non viewable when we finally sat down to watch with error messages that took months to get a clear answer on from your phone people.  Also the fact that my bill was triple what promised and I still did not get the few cheap channels I needed. The fact that we have to also watch commercials galore after already paying a small fortune for your sloppy service is theft . Commercials should be paying you enough for the service to more than pay you.. I mean tons of commercials (20 to 45%).. So your salesman's promised me a trial period.  From the first month you would not send me your return boxes. You convinced me you would wave my fees if I gave your technicians a chance to fix my service extending the nightmare for months which you later charged me for.. Your technician's finally came and called it an unfixable Glitch. (Said he had the same problem at his home) Then 3 months after I thought my life was free from you. You suddenly stole 570 dollars from my account because I was stupid enough to give you guys my charge card numbers before installation. (why didn't I check the BBB?)  Nobody once ever called me back after spending 30 hours on the phone with you guys and never getting anywhere but a bad ride of lies. In the end you never called me back. But kept hanging up on me while waiting for managers. forced to go through the chain of managers all over again several times. A lesser manager finally warned me that in 10 years of working there no body had ever been released of the unauthorized debit like the 571 dollars that was taken from account without permission. (Against policy to reverse pending charges on my card) So next I promised in a few weeks they will call me LOL and my bank says it will take up 90 days to dispute the theft. So now my daughters Birthday party was ruined on top of it by the unauthorized 571 dollars they stole from us. All together they are trying to get like over a thousand dollars from us for a few months of HELL. they claim they have no record of the promise that if I let a Technician come out that they would wave my contract fees.. But months later yesterday they said I would have had to give their technician 5 trys to have gotten the set up fees forgiven.. (After the fact) So you see the long web of lies they use to keep you racking up months of charges? Thankfully I got out after a few months of HELL. Unfortunately I will be forced to pay for years of service anyway without any tv by DTV scum of the earth.  Hopefully I can afford a lawyer I sued them for the Hell they put me through and I am 55 and have never Sued anybody before in my life.. I give up on you guys.. DONE DONE DONE. you are running out of time to call me and do the right thing.
